## Why RShiny?

### Introduction
RShiny is a powerful framework for building web applications using R. In this section, we will explore why RShiny has become an essential tool for data scientists and analysts.

### Features
- **Reactivity**: Allows your data visualizations to change in real-time.
- **Customizability**: Provides a variety of themes and widgets to make your app unique.
- **Ease of Use**: Requires just a basic understanding of R to get started.
---
### Advantages Over Other Tools
- **Integration with R**: Seamless compatibility with various R packages.
- **No need for web development skills**: You can create sophisticated web apps without knowing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript (although these can be added for more customization).
---

#### Exercise 1: Setting Up Your Shiny App



- **What You Will Learn**
  - How to create the basic structure of a Shiny app
  - Familiarize yourself with Shiny UI and server components

---

- **In the User Interface (UI) Section**
  - Define the UI for your app in the `ui.R` file, or simply a ui and server function.
  - Use `fluidPage`, `navbarPage`, or your preferred layout structure.
  
  - Example UI Code:
  
```R
    library(shiny)

    ui <- fluidPage(
      titlePanel("My Shiny App"),
      sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
          # Add UI elements here
        ),
        mainPanel(
          # Add UI elements here
        )
      )
    )
```

---

- **In the Server Logic Section**
  - Define the server logic for your app in the `server.R`  file or server function.
  - This can be left empty for now.
  
  - Example Server Code:
  
```R
    library(shiny)

    server <- function(input, output) {
      # Define server logic here
    }
    ```

---

- **Running Your App**
  - Run your application using `shinyApp(ui, server)` or pressing the run app button on RStudio.
  
  - Example:
```R
    shinyApp(ui, server)
    ```

---

- **Observing the Result**
  - A new window or tab should open, displaying your Shiny app with the default layout.
  - Note the basic structure of the app with UI elements and an empty server.

---

- **Points to Consider**
  - Take some time to explore the basic structure of a Shiny app.
  - Familiarize yourself with the `ui.R` and `server.R` files (or functions).
  - In the following exercises, we'll build upon this foundation to create interactive and data-driven apps.

---

- **Hints**
  - Remember, every Shiny app has a user interface (UI) and a server (server logic).
  - You can customize the appearance of your app in `ui.R` and define its behavior in `server.R`.

---


  
### Introduction to navbarPage

The `navbarPage` function in Shiny allows you to create a navigation bar at the top of your app, giving you the capability to organize various parts of your app into separate tabs. It serves as the main UI container for your Shiny application.


```R
ui <- navbarPage(
  "App Title",  # The title of your app, displayed on the navbar
  tabPanel("Tab 1"),  # The first tab
  tabPanel("Tab 2")   # The second tab
)
```


#### Exercise 2: User Interface and File Input



- **What You Will Learn**
  - How to create the user interface (UI) for your Shiny app
  - Adding file input functionality to your app
  
---

- **Required Packages**
  - Load the necessary packages:
    - `shiny`
    - `bslib`

---

- **UI Layout**
  - Enhance the UI layout of your app using `fluidPage`.
  - Achieve a responsive layout with `fluidPage`.

```R
ui <- fluidPage(...)
```

---

- **Styling with bslib**
  - Improve the appearance of your app using Bootstrap themes with `bslib`.

```R
theme = bs_theme(version = 5, bootswatch = "cerulean")
```

---

- **Text Formatting with HTML Tags**
  - Use HTML tags like `h1`, `hr`, and `p` for text formatting.

```R
h1("Welcome to the Shiny Workshop!")
hr()
p("In this exercise, you have added File Input for Demographics.")
```

-  Type `names(tags)` to see a list of supported HTML tags
-  Why not try a few out!

---

- **File Input: `fileInput`**
  - Allow users to upload files directly into the application with `fileInput`.

```R
fileInput('dmFile', 'Choose Demographics File', accept = c('.xpt'))
```

      haven::read_xpt(input$dmFile$datapath)
    })
    ```

    req(input$dmFile)
    read_xpt(input$dmFile$datapath)
  })
  
  mean_age_data <- reactive({
    dm_data() %>%
      group_by(ACTARM) %>%
